&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong id="internal-source-marker_0.4872122521046549"&gt;BBP (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fblueboyproductions.net%2F&amp;amp;h=rAQHaNQ4W&amp;amp;s=1"&gt;http://blueboyproductions.net/&lt;/a&gt;)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;is a live electronic dance music duo specializing in intense bass heavy songs that span the genres of EDM, blending live instruments with samples and original productions in a way that allows for real improvisation and unrehearsed moments of creativity and spontaneity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having established a solid presence throughout the Northeast US, BBP is starting to make a name throughout the world with an innovative and interesting style of live bass music. Their "Dabs O' Honey" Spring tour employs a custom video mapped honeycomb design with Drew Suto providing visuals. Last spring's debut full length album "Robot/Alien Variety Hour" brought acclaim from critics and fans alike, creating a number of classics that pleased crowds at festivals throughout the Northeast during Summer 2012. Recent releases include remixes of Busta Rhymes "Woo Hah", and Collective Efforts "Until My Life's Gone" as well as an original track "Vex" - all available for free download at&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong id="internal-source-marker_0.4872122521046549"&gt;Timbre Coup:&lt;br /&gt;-Timbre [tam-ber]: the characteristic quality of sound produced by a particular instrument or voice; tone color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Coup [koo]: a sudden successful, unexpected stroke, act or move; a hostile takeover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Formed in 2007, Timbre Coup is a progressive rock band hailing from Albany New York. The band is comprised of Dan Gerken (guitar/bass/vocals), Andrew Chamberlaine (guitar), Ben (guitar/bass) and brother Matt Pickering (drums).&lt;br /&gt;In their time together as a band, the members of Timbre Coup have become a cohesive force to be reckoned with. Often compared to groups such as King Crimson and Umphrey's McGee, this prog (or "improg") band also has a very danceable side. "We want people to pay attention to the details and intricacies of our songs, but we love making people dance." says drummer Matt Pickering. "Our music was as accepted at Camp Bisco as it was at MoeDown."&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of festivals, this young group has had the opportunity to perform at SnoeDown, MoeDown, Mountain Jam, Catskill Chill, and Camp Bisco, to name a few. Pair that with support slots for The New Deal, Brothers Past, Project/Object, Consider the Source, UMelt, etc. and there's no wonder why these boys have been picking up so much steam on the East Coast. Since April 2012, touring has extended from the most Northeastern regions of the country, down the Savannah GA and everywhere in between. It's only a matter of time before fans all across the US will be able to see Timbre Coup in their hometown.&lt;br /&gt;With three full length albums under their belt, the band will return to the studio in early 2013 and plans on releasing a double disc album soon after. But for now, the concept album Knuckles &amp;amp; Valleys is Timbre Coup's most recent release (February 23rd 2012). For a band that is known for both heavy, progressive riffs and spacey grooves, and for being able to both shred hard and create intricate upbeat melodies, Knuckles &amp;amp; Valleys proves to be a mature whirlwind of genres, wonderfully blended into compositions that show a band at a new height of progress and song craft.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong id="internal-source-marker_0.4872122521046549"&gt;Phillosopher:&lt;br /&gt;In 2010, Charleston, SC based Dj/Producer Phillip Surrett combined forces with Drummer/ Percussionist Dylan Lorditch To create the high energy Live improvisational EDM 2 piece that is Phillosopher.

Blending aspects of Hip Hop/Electronica/Funk/Reggae they Deliver a flash force of organic, on the fly Booty shakin' dance grooves for your listening pleasure. In the Diverse and ever evolving genre of Live EDM Phillosopher is sinking there feet in deep as one of the most creative and original acts to take the stage today.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
